What Is a Shell Script?
- A shell script is simply a file containing Linux commands written in sequence.
eg : echo "Hello, World!"
      ls -l
      pwd
If you run this script, it will: Print a message, List directory contents, Show your current location.

**Shebang (#!) Explained :
The first line in every script is: #!/bin/bash
This is called the shebang line. It tells the system which interpreter to use to run the script (in this case, Bash). If you used #!/usr/bin/env bash, it automatically finds Bash even if it’s in a different location. Without the shebang, the script might run incorrectly or use a different shell.

**Using Variables :   Variables store data (like text or numbers) that can be used later in your script.
#!/bin/bash
name="Amar"
echo "Hello, $name!"
 OUTPUT - Hello, Amar!
No spaces around =
✅ name="Amar"
❌ name = "Amar" (wrong)
Variables are case-sensitive
Name ≠ name
Use $ to access variable value
Example: $name

**System variables (environment variables)
Already defined by Linux:
Variable	Description
$USER	Current logged user
$HOME	Home directory
$PWD	Present working directory
$SHELL	Shell used
$HOSTNAME	Computer name

#!/bin/bash
echo "You are logged in as $USER"
echo "Your home directory is $HOME"
